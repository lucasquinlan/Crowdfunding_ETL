# Crowdfunding_ETL

For the ETL mini project, we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. 
After the data was transformed, four CSV files were created and we used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, the CSV file data was loaded into a Postgres database.
